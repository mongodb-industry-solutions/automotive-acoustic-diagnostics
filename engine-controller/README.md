To replicate the real use case of a machine, we are using the 4-cylinder Engine replica Teching DM13. We decided to use this specific hardware because it's all made of metal, which makes it more sturdy for traveling and testing, and also because it was the right combination of cost, size and functionality between all the hardware we evaluated. But in reality this demo can be run with any piece of hardware (even a real machine!) that can run and make some noise.

The product requires the user to assemble the parts, and the parts move thanks to an electric motor connected to a set cog wheels, and chains that make its parts move. The electric motor is powered by a 500mAh Lithium Battery that can be charged.

This is an standalone product, that has a ON/OFF manual switch to power it. In order for us to be able to control the engine through MongoDB Atlas, we had to intervene.

That meant to connect the ON/OFF manual switch to a Relay (which is simply an electronically operated switch), so we don't have to turn the switch to our hands. Then, we connected the Relay to a Raspberry Pi 5 which will be the bridge to host the software that communicates with the Cloud.

### Raspberry Pi 5

We are going to use a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB for this demo. Here's the detailed information about our specific model:

    OS: Ubuntu 23.10 aarch64
    Host: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0
    Kernel: 6.5.0-1009-raspi Shell: bash 5.2.15
    DE: GNOME 45.2
    WM: Mutter
    WM Theme: Adwaita
    Theme: Yaru [GTK2/3]
    cons: Yaru [GTK2/3]
    Terminal: gnome-terminal
    CPU: BCM2835 (4) @ 2.400GHz
    Memory: 1927MiB / 7943MiB

Additionally, there are a few extra items we got:

- 27W Power Delivery (The 15W power adapter wonâ€™t be enough to power the all the items)
- MicroSD of 256GBs, this is to store the OS.
- Cable HDMI-mHDMI 2.0

For this demo we used the 5V relay KF-301:

### Hardware Connections

This is how we electrically connected the Raspberry Pi (left of the image) to the Relay, and the Relay to the ON/OFF switch sockets of the engine (right of the image)

##### Proximity Sensor Cable Schematic

> [!TIP]
> The python scripts used on this demo refer directly to specific pins, so make sure you either follow the above schematic exactly, or you edit the scripts on `engine_controler/` so the program uses the necessary pins of the Raspberry Pi.

By the end, the RPi should have 3 things connected to its pins:

- Relay to control the engine
- Traffic Light Sensor
- Infrared Proximity Sensor

And this is it! congratulations on setting up the physical connection of the hardware, now let's go an run the programs on the Raspberry Pi 5!

## Raspberry Pi Control

To run the programs open 3 terminals:

In one terminal type:
`cd engine_controler`
`node server.js`

In the other terminal terminal:
`cd engine_controler/realm`
`node app.js`

In the last terminal:
`cd engine_controler`
`python3 sensors_read.py`

Now all the Sensors on the Raspberry Pi should be running!!!! :D

#### Basic Troubleshooting

- If you see weird behaviors with the Sensors (Relay Clipping, LEDs not turning On, InfraRed Sensor not working, engine turning on and off constantly)
  - Disconnect the engine (always first)
  - Make sure there are no obstacles obstructing the IR (Infrared) sensor
  - Double check the cable connections
- If you see some errors on the Terminals
  - Disconnect the engine (always first)
  - Stop the Terminals
  - Go to Atlas and make sure everything is working fine in Atlas.
  - Re-start the programs

# Setup

RaspBerry Pi 5:

```
OS: Ubuntu 23.10 aarch64
Host: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0
Kernel: 6.5.0-1009-raspi Shell: bash 5.2.15
DE: GNOME 45.2
WM: Mutter
WM Theme: Adwaita
Theme: Yaru [GTK2/3]
cons: Yaru [GTK2/3]
Terminal: gnome-terminal
CPU: BCM2835 (4) @ 2.400GHz
Memory: 1927MiB / 7943MiB
```

Relay:
`KF-301 1 relay 5V module`
Even thought the Relay name is 5V, it has to be connected to a 3.3V pin on the the RPi 5 for the power supply.

Engine:
`4-Cylinder Engine DM13 TECHING`

# Instructions

## Prerequisites

```
apt install python3-dotenv
apt install python3-pymongo
apt install python3-gpiozero
```

> [!WARNING]
> The library `gpiozero` has issues to run in a venv python environment. We suggest installing the libraries globally.

## Instruction

From the `engine_controller` folder, run the command below in the Raspberry Pi 5 terminal to start the controller.

```
python3 main.py
```
